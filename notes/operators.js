// OPERATORS

// In JS operators are functions:
// +
// -
// *
// /
// >, >=, <, <=, =

//* Prefix notation: + 3, 4
//* Postfix notation: 3, 4+
//* Infix notation: 3 + 4

//var a = 3 + 4;  //* This is essentially a function call that takes two values and adds them together.
//console.log(a);  //* This will output 7. The JS engine knows this is seven, because the + sign is an operator.
