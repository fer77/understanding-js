// OPERATOR PRECEDENCE AND ASSOCIATIVITY

//var a = 2,
//    b = 3,
//    c = 4;

//a = b = c;

//* All three will log 4, because of associativity.  The = operator has an associativity of 'right-to-left' (see operator associativity).
//console.log(a);
//console.log(b);
//console.log(c);

//var a = 3 + 4 * 5; //* Logs 23, because associativity places * higher in precedence than +

//var a = (3 + 4) * 5; //* Logs 35, because associativity places () higher in precedence than any other operator.

//console.log(a);
